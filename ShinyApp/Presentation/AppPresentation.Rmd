## Introduction

### Problem:
- Understanding the relationship between car characteristics (horsepower, weight, and number of cylinders) and fuel efficiency (MPG).

### Objective:
- Create an interactive tool that predicts MPG based on user input values for horsepower, weight, and number of cylinders.

---

## How the Application Works

### UI Overview:
- Sidebar with sliders to adjust horsepower, weight, and cylinders.
- Action button to trigger prediction update.

### Server Logic:
- Linear regression model used to predict MPG.
- Reactively updates data and visualizations based on user inputs.

```{r}
# Embedded R code to showcase the linear regression model
library(shiny)
data(mtcars)

# Linear model
lm_model <- lm(mpg ~ hp + wt + cyl, data = mtcars)
summary(lm_model)

```
