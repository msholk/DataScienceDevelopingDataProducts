# Predicting MPG with Linear Regression

Welcome to the presentation on predicting miles per gallon (MPG) using linear regression.

---

## Introduction

### Problem:
- Understanding the relationship between car characteristics (horsepower, weight, and number of cylinders) and fuel efficiency (MPG).

### Objective:
- Create an interactive tool that predicts MPG based on user input values for horsepower, weight, and number of cylinders.

---

## How the Application Works

### UI Overview:
- Sidebar with sliders to adjust horsepower, weight, and cylinders.
- Action button to trigger prediction update.

### Server Logic:
- Linear regression model used to predict MPG.
- Reactively updates data and visualizations based on user inputs.

## Example Model Output

```{r}
# Embedded R code to showcase the linear regression model
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)

# Sample linear regression model
data(mtcars)
model <- lm(mpg ~ hp + wt + cyl, data = mtcars)

# Sample prediction code
predict_mpg <- function(hp, wt, cyl) {
  predict(model, newdata = data.frame(hp = hp, wt = wt, cyl = cyl))
}

# Example prediction output
predict_mpg(150, 2.5, 6)
```

## Conclusion

This tool enables users to predict MPG based on car characteristics. The application dynamically updates based on input values and offers an interactive interface to explore relationships between variables.
